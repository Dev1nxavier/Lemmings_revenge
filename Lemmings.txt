Lemmings! The Game. 

1. Game Design Document
Before jumping into coding, sketch out a simple design document for the first level, detailing the following:
	•	Objective: Get X number of characters from the entrance to the exit.
	•	Skills Available: For the first level, keep it simple, perhaps only one skill like digging or building a bridge.
	•	Hazards: There should be minimal to no hazards in the first level to keep the focus on learning the basic mechanics.
	•	Layout: A simple layout with perhaps a single obstacle that requires the use of the available skill.
2. Setting Up the Java Project
	•	Create a new Java project in your IDE.
	•	Set up your main class and JFrame window.
	•	Implement a JPanel that will serve as the main game panel where the level will be drawn.
3. Designing the Level
	•	Using a simple paint program or graph paper, design the level layout.
	•	Decide where the entrance and exit will be and what the obstacle will be.
	•	Translate this design into a data structure within your Java code. You could use a 2D array to represent the level, where different numbers represent different elements like empty space, ground, and the exit.
4. Basic Character Logic
	•	Create a character class that contains the character's position and state (e.g., walking, using a skill).
	•	Implement the logic that makes the characters move automatically. For the first level, they might only need to be able to walk and turn around at walls.
5. Implementing Skills
	•	Code the logic for the one skill you've chosen. For example, if it’s digging, the character would remove a block of ground from the level data structure.
6. Interaction
	•	Implement mouse listeners to allow the player to click on characters and assign them the skill.
	•	Make sure that the skill can only be used a set number of times.
7. Rendering the Level and Characters
	•	In the paintComponent method of your game panel, draw the level and characters.
	•	Use simple shapes or colors to represent different elements. For instance, characters could be blue circles, the ground could be brown rectangles, and the exit could be a green square.
8. Game Loop
	•	Set up a game loop that updates the game state. This includes moving characters and checking for the completion of the level.
	•	Use a Swing timer to trigger updates and repaints at a consistent rate.
9. Win Condition
	•	Check if the required number of characters has reached the exit.
	•	When the condition is met, display a simple message or dialog that the level is complete.
10. Polishing
	•	Refine the user interface, perhaps adding instructions for the level and a counter for how many characters have been saved.
	•	Add some simple animations or effects when a character uses a skill.
11. Testing
	•	Playtest the level yourself and adjust the difficulty if needed.
	•	Have others playtest to ensure the instructions are clear and the level is fun.
12. Refactoring and Documentation
	•	After the level is working, go back through your code to refactor and improve the design where necessary.
	•	Add comments and documentation to make it clear what each part of the code is doing.
13. Future Considerations
	•	Think about how you will manage multiple levels and store the level designs.
	•	Consider how you might add more skills and complexity in future levels.
